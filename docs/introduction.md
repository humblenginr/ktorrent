Basically I don't know how BitTorrent protocol works. Peer-to-peer communication is something that I wanted to explore for a long time now. 

Building a BitTorrent client would be a very good experience for me in terms of learning how the protocol actually works. 

I am also thinking of using Rust for this. I could just use Go which will help me focus on learning more about the BitTorrent implementation. But sooner or later I will have to use Rust and hence I think this is a good opportunity for me to do that.
